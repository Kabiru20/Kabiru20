## Hi, I’m Kabiru 

I work across data science, econometrics, data engineering, and database
development, with a strong focus on understanding structure, dynamics,
and uncertainty in real-world data.

My interests span **time series modeling, econometric analysis, applied
statistical research**, and the design of **robust data pipelines and
database systems** that support reliable, reproducible analysis.

I aim to combine solid theoretical foundations with practical engineering
choices to produce results that are interpretable, scalable, and defensible.

## Selected Work

### Data Analytics, Modeling, and Research Projects
A collection of projects that explore structured datasets using
econometric reasoning, statistical methods, and machine learning,
supported by well-designed SQL schemas and reproducible data pipelines.

Common themes across projects:
- Careful problem formulation and assumption checking  
- Separation of data ingestion, transformation, and analysis  
- Balancing theory-driven models with data-driven approaches  
- Emphasis on interpretability, diagnostics, and data quality

## Approach & Philosophy

I approach data problems by first understanding the data-generating
process and research question, then designing databases, pipelines,
and models that are appropriate in terms of assumptions, performance,
and maintainability.

I value:
- Sound statistical reasoning over unnecessary complexity  
- Clear schemas and queries over ad-hoc data access  
- Diagnostics and validation over blind optimization  
- Reproducibility and clarity over one-off analysis  

Models, databases, and pipelines are tools; insight, reliability,
and rigor are the objective.
